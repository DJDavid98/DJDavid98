# DJDavid98

Iâ€™m a hobbyist digital artist who loves drawing animals in his free time. My personal favourite species are foxes, but I like canines in general, besides other four-legged creatures. I consider myself to be part of the larger furry community. I occasionally participate in related events to relax, or to hang out with friends.

Why look at my code when my OCs are so much cuter?
